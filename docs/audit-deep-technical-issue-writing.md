# /audit — Deep Technical Issue Writing Gate

Required addendum for `/audit`.

An audit issue must be technical enough that another agent can implement the fix without rediscovering the whole codebase.

Do not create vague issues like “improve mobile UX” or “fix cabinet”. Map symptoms to files, components, state/data paths, styles, and verification steps.

## Required code-trace chain

Before writing the issue, inspect and document:

```txt
route/page -> layout shell -> visible component -> child component -> state/store -> data/API/persistence -> formatting/rendering -> styles/responsive rules -> tests/checks
```

For each inspected file:

```txt
File:
Why relevant:
What it controls:
Evidence found:
Risk if changed:
```

## Required issue sections

```md
## Technical code trace
| Layer | File/function/component | Evidence | What likely needs to change | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Confirmed vs suspected
### Confirmed from code
- ...

### Suspected / needs verification
- ...

## Implementation map
| Step | File/function/component | Change | Why | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Do-not-touch
- Auth boundaries
- Production data
- Unrelated routes/components
- Existing saved/history data

## Verification plan
- Build/check commands
- Route(s) to open
- Mobile viewport
- Desktop viewport
- Data/auth-safe proof
- Regression checks

## Ready-to-run /delivery prompt
/delivery
Task:
...
```

## Evidence labels

- `CODE VERIFIED` — actual file/function inspected.
- `RUNTIME VERIFIED` — checked via local/live endpoint/screenshot/tool.
- `LIKELY` — inferred from names/imports but not fully verified.
- `NOT VERIFIED` — unknown or blocked.

Do not present guesses as facts.

## Handoff quality bar

The final `/delivery` prompt must include repo, local path if known, target branch, route/page/component target, files/functions to inspect first, ranked root-cause hypothesis, implementation steps, do-not-touch rules, checks, UI proof, and auth-safe proof rules when relevant.

If code access was unavailable, mark the issue `PARTIAL_CODE_LIMITATION`.
